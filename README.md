# My Celsius to FreedomUnits Converter

This mini project allowed me to dive deep into conversions and eventListeners.
Although the conversion was readily available to me via google, I had to play around with variables and assign values in order to give the accurate conversion.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 

Starting with more focused and smaller projects allowed me to embrace versatile functions and all its capabilities. In doing so, I was also able to active recall my CSS skills while diving deep into focus mode on very basic fundamental functions like conversions and eventListeners.

## Optimizations
*function code block repitition to get comfortable with javaScript*

## Lessons Learned:

Learned that everything commmented out will not affect the speed & optimization on a site. With the codeblock re-written and commented out a dozen times, I was worried
that it may affect the speed. This allowed me to get more comfortable with adding comments to each of my steps in future projects and work.  
Learned that with practice can come perfect. One step closer to perfecting the foundations of user interaction. 

Impletementing eventListeners and functions. 

*fuck yeah I did it!*

also, CSS gets easier when JS takes half the load.
